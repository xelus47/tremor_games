PHPSESSID, aka md5 or sha1 (depending on settings), aka hash code


php specification for PHPSESS generation here:
https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/d9bfe06194ae8f760cb43a3e7120d0503f327398/ext/session/session.c#L284


The code is either 16 or 20 chars long

Before brute forcing, check if maybe it's some kind of string to hex, i.e.:
	> "hallo" --> 68 61 6c 6c 6f
Another way to reduce hash brute forcing is knowing the character range (after converting to lower())



QUESTION!!!
For how long are SESSIDs authorized and are they case-sensitive (or always upper/lower)?



hash codes are either 16 or 20 chars long

16 chars: 16^16 /(1*3600*24) = 2.1*10^14
20 chars: 20^16 /(1*3600*24) = 7.5*10^14

  [Options]^[range] per seconds every day = something with 14 zeros number of days, checking 1 code every second
